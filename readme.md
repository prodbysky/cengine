# CEngine - Game engine in C++

## Precursor
I have made a finished (in my opinion) game library [Open-mover](github.com/prodbysky/open-mover),
And I have now decided to make a full fledged engine, based on my experience on Open-Mover.
Will be working on this engine following Chernos [Game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)


## To run SandBox:
```console
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=bin/debug/CEngine/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./bin/debug/SandBox/main
```
